Combination artifacts work a bit different than you are used to. Now it is enough to wear only a part of the set to get some bonuses. 
For example if you wear three pieces of the Battle Mages War Dress you will get 2 additional attack and defense. 
Some combination aritfacts like the Angelic Alliance can either be assembled or left unassembled. The bonus will be different and you have to choose one. This should add a little bit more variety to your choices.

Commander artifacts can either be worn by the hero or by the commander, the bonus will then be different.
