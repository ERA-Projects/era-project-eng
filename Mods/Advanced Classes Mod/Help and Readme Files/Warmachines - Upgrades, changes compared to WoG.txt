Your commander can have only 1 of each Warmachine in his backpack.
Each WM can be upgraded in town by right-clicking the blacksmith (Upgrades) and right-clicking the mage guild (Enchantements).

You can view the current upgrades by right-clicking on the warmachines in the hero screen.

First Aid Tent:
Your First Aid Tent can resurrect lost troops in combat. The amount it can resurrect depends on your Heal Capacity which is indicated ba the damage value of your First Aid Tent in combat.
Heal Capacity is 3% of your total army HP + some other bonuses. Once it is depleted you can only heal troops in combat and not resurrect them.

Ballista:
the damage of ballista scales with your hero attack multiplied by the base damage of your ballista. So skills and artifacts increasing the base damage are very valuable to pump up your damage.

Ammo Cart:
It provides unlimited shots to your troops.
It also restores some spell points after combat and increases the damage of certain secondary skill effects. Right-Click in hero backpack for more information.
