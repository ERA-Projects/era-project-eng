The following 9 base classes are available:

Fighter - Usually focuses on melee attacks and dealing damage.
Ranger - Usually focuses on shooting and ranged attacks.
Defender Usually focuses on defense and disrupting the enemies.
Caster - Usually focuses on casting damage spells.
Supporter - Usually focuses on casting supportive spells and using the commander's passive ability. Has different bonuses for each commander type.
Leader - Usually focuses on leading the army by providing certain boosts to your army.
Scout - Usually focuses on multiple attacks and generating resources in combat.
Vampire - Your commander becomes partly undead, losing 33% of its total health. Requires Necromancy to perform the ritual. Vampires restore 25% of the damage dealt as HP.
(Secret Class) - Needs to be unlocked first.

Each class influences the attributes of your commander and can increase certain attributes further by killing enemies in combat. 
If your commander has chosen a class he will get +1 kill count after level 10 and by killing enemies. 
Masteries: Each class has a unique Mastery that gets unlocked when having reached enough kills.

The 8 attributes for the Commanders are:

Attack - Just attack value
Defense - Just defense value
Damage - Just damage value min+max
Health - Influences total hit points
Speed - Influences speed
Spells - Influences the power of spells. Each spell now has a scaling with this modifier. Meaning it will also change the power of spells like Bloodlust, Magic Arrow, Power-Cure and so on. For different spells, the modifier will have different effects.
Passive - Influences the passive of every commander. Each passive now has a scaling with this modifier. Eg: the Brute will generate more gold with attacks, the Necro will raise more skeletons, the Astral Spirit will reduce the health and damage of enemies further and so on...
Aura - The leader commander emits a 1 hex aura that buffs allied units standing next to him. The effect gets increased. The range of the aura can also be expanded.

When reaching a kill count of 30 you can specialise your commander class further. A total of 18 new classes are available. These classes dont scale on a primary attribute, but rather have a unique scaling of a special attribute.
