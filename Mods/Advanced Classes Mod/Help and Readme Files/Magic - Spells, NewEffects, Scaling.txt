Changes to the Magic System


You ever felt that it made no sense that a level 5 hero can cast Stoneskin with the same effect than a mighty level 50 wizard? 
This Mod gives nearly all spells a scaling with spell power which hadn't one before! The effect of the spell is now based on your heroes total "Magic Strength" [MS]
MS is a combination of the hero spell power and his magic based secondary skills! 
Check your current value of Magic Strength by right-clicking the knowledge icon in your hero screen. The value will be indicated in the top left corner.
If you now pick Sorcery as a secondary skill it will give you +10 MS at expert level. +10 to MS will most likely result in one extra level for most of your spells. So no more buffing damage spells only.
A lot of other magic skills as wisdom, scholar or the magic schools will give you a certain amount to you MS. This system prevents strong might heroes, which happen to have high spell power, 
from gaining the same strong spells as a pure magic hero will get! 

To keep balance all spells start at a lower level. At around 20 to 30 MS factor you will get the same values as original H3 spells. But after that value, your spells will become stronger the more spell power you have.
Most spells cost more spell points than before, this makes it more important for casting heroes to take care of their spell points.

How to calculate Magic Strength value:
MS=(Spell_Power+SecSkills_Bonus)*Map_Modifier*Spell_Trainer

Map coefficient 
[+20% Bonus on S size map]
[+10% Bonus on M size map]
[0 penalty on L size map]
[-15% penalty on XL size map]
[-20% penalty on XXL size map]

If Spell Trainer Mod is active you get -25% Magic Strength value

Scalings. Every value here and in spells is rounded down.
Percentage: 15->3, 25->8, 50->15, 50->17, 85->20, 100->25, extra 3 per 10 MS after. (Shield27, Air Shield28, 4 Protections from Element30-33, Magic Mirror36, Slow54.)
Slow: 2% per 5MS
Attack/Defence: 25->1, 30->2, 35->3, 45->4, 55->5, 70->6, 90->7, 105->8, extra 1 per 10 MS after.
Bless Curse Damage: 25->1, 60->2, 100->3, 150->4 MS.
Morale/Luck/Retals: 40->1, 70->2, then 3 after 110 MS.
Haste/Prayer: 35->1, 45->2, 75->3, then 4 after 110 MS.
Summons: +20HP per Magic Strength.
Fire Shield: 20%-melee-damage +20*SP+(Level of Fire Magic) damage is returned
