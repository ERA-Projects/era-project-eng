Create YourMod\RandomSkin\Unique Name.txt file. File consists of groups, separated by '*' character. Each item occupies one line:

file 1
file 1 alt 1
file 1 alt 2
file 1 alt 3
*
file 2
file 2 alt 1
file 2 alt 2

Each time you start/load game/saved game/battle a random file is selected from each group and is used as contents for group first item. Example:

zpic1005.pcx
some pic 1.pcx
some pic 2.pcx

This is a group of 3 images, one of them is selected randomly and is used as "zpic1005.pcx" resource (main menu background).
Another example:

zpic1005.pcx
some pic 1.pcx
some pic 2.pcx

zpic1000.pcx
some pic 3.pcx
some pic 4.pcx
