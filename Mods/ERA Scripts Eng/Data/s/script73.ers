Option 351 [Author - Archer30]

Cover of Darkness (both the Necropolis building and the map object) and Veil of Darkness (Darkness Dragon's ability) no longer cover the map, instead:

Cover of Darkness as a Necropolis building reduces an intruder hero's morale by -1 when defending against a siege.

Cover of Darkness as a map object protects the hero from attacks by other heroes until the end of the second day. The effect will disapperar if the hero enters a battle.

Darkness Dragon's Veil of Darkness casts Disguise on the hero every day.
