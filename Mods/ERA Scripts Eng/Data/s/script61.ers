Option 790 [Author - daemon_n, Archer30, Idea - Algor]

This script expands the "Magic Arrow" spell, making it possible to use all available mana to deal extra damage (*).

Damage = Power * Mana : 2 + X * Mana, where X = max(Air/Water/Earth/Fire) Magic skill (0-3)

Ciele, as a Magic Arrow specialist, gets damage bonus +5% per hero level.

AI always uses all mana using "Magic Arrow".

* If the new damage is less than the standard, ordinary "Magic Arrow" is used.
