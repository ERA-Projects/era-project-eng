A large platform mod that turns regular neutrals on the map into mixed ones (up to 7 different slots).
It includes many options and settings, such as aggressiveness, disabling morale, slot generation and distribution modes, configuration probabilities, fine-tuning slots for specific types of monsters, etc.

Settings are changed by mini-mods via json files or ERM.
