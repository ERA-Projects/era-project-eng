============================================================================

  This file contains most of the development history of Smacker.

  It contains changes, updates, and fixes in the Smacker Tools, the
  Smacker SDK, and the Smacker Xtra.

============================================================================

4.1 a - 3/15/02
---------------
Added an all new Bink audio encoder!  Sounds much better and can compress
  up to half the old data rate!"

Added crash protection around all calls to Windows or QuickTime - we should
  now withstand crashes in buggy 3rd party codecs.  The specific frame that
  was being decompressed will be blank, but the rest of the movie should
  survive.

Added lots of new configuration detection to the System Info button in the
  RAD Video Tools (Duron, P4, Celeron, Itanium, Me, 2000, XP, video card,
  audio card, memory, and disk space).

Detect larger than 2 GB AVI files and warn the user that they are not
  supported by the Windows reader.

4.0 k - 1/21/02
---------------
Fixed a timer wrap around problem that prevented Smacker movies from looping
  indefinitely.

Updated the Mac to 4.0k.

Added Carbon versions of the Smacker library.

Rewrote the Mac Smacker example player.

Released new versions of the player in both Carbon (MacOS X compatible) and
  CFM versions.

4.0 j - 8/21/01
---------------
Fixed a crash under the debugger when using the SMACKFROMMEMORY flag.

Added a workaround in the Smacker timer code for buggy motherboards that
  advance the QueryPerformanceCounter incorrectly under heavy loads.

Added new QuickTime importing code to support the video track of MPEG and
  Flash movies. QuickTime doesn't support audio exporting from either of
  these file types yet, unfortunately.

Added new QuickTime importing code to support AVIs that Windows can't open
  (like DV formatted AVIs).

Added new audio encoder that provides much higher quality sound on deep
  tones (may still have to use 0 lossy level on some files, though).

Fixed compression of unusual AVIs where the video stream format doesn't match
  the file format (usually seen in Debabilizer AVI files).

Fixed a bug compressing unusual QuickTime movies where the audio started at
  a non-zero offset.

4.0 i - 9/09/00
---------------
Fixed a subtle bug in the QuickTime importer where the first frame was
  sometimes duplicated.

Added new 256-color small and large icons.

Fixed the non-client area not being redrawn in the players after a window
  resize under Win2K.

Changed a few variable names in RAD.H to avoid conflicts with AMD's 3DNow 
  header file.

Fixed a bug where a list file containing files with different original frame 
  rates would wrap around if an adjusted frame rate was used on the list 
  file.

4.0 h - 8/25/00
---------------
Fixed an obscure stuttering problem when using SmackGoto to jump back to
  frame one when another Smacker file with sound was open.

4.0 g - 7/10/00
---------------
Fixed a frame pausing problem when calling SmackSoundOnOff during playback.

Fixed a subtle aliasing error when using the "adjust to frame rate" option
  with non-integral multiples.

Switched to a new EXE compressor (UPX) under Win32 that gets better
  compression and should be more widely compatible.

4.0 f - 6/26/00
---------------
Switched to the real FFT instead of the complex FFT which can double audio
  decompression performance on some CPUs

4.0 e - 6/14/00
---------------
Added the ability to directly play compiled to EXE Smacker files.

Fixed an offset bug when using negative X offsets in the RAD graphics file 
  importer when outputting true-color files.

Added the new RADSetMemory function that allows you to replace Smacker's 
  memory allocation and freeing routines on both PC and Mac.

Switched to a faster FFT routine (speeds up audio decompression).

Fixed a crash when importing a Smacker file with Bink audio.

The Smacker mixer can now remove a sound track (use "-" for the sound track
  name).

The Smacker player can now hide the mouse cursor during playback.

4.0 d - 4/5/00
--------------
First version of Smacker 4.0 for the Mac!  PowerPC and 68K are both
  supported (you should avoid using Bink audio in Smacker files that will
  be played on 68K machines, though).

Fixed a bug in the Smacker encoder where files compressed with Bink audio
  tracks would be aligned incorrectly.  This led to too slow Smacker files
  on the PC and unplayable files on the Mac.  You have to recompress the
  Smacker file to fix the problem, though.

Renamed the SmackTimerRead function to RADTimerRead and switched to using
  QueryPerformanceCounter (from timeGetTime) on Win32 - should make Smacker
  movies play a little more smoothly on Windows NT and 2000.

Fixed a bug in the SmackGetRects function where an extra bogus rectangle
  would be returned on a frame where a palette change occurred, but no
  pixels changed.

Broke out the time spent in the audio and video decoders into separate
  values.

Fixed a bug in the Smacker player that cause an extra millisecond of sleep
  for every frame.

Fixed a crash in the Mac SmackBuffer API when a NULL rectangle was passing
  to SmackBufferBlit.

You can now override settings on the command line with a remove switch.  For 
  example, if you run "SmackPlw test /L", you can tell Smacker to
  ignore the loop switch with "SmackPlw test /L /-L".  The "slash-minus-L"
  tells Smacker to skip the earlier L switch.  This is mostly useful for
  overriding the switches that are compiled into a self-playing Bink or
  Smacker file.

4.0 c - 2/8/00
--------------
Fixed a bug in the QuickTime sound importer - there should be no more
  glitches with compressed MOV soundtracks, MP3 files or other compressed
  wave files.

Made the Bink and Smacker players for Win32 take longer lists of filenames
  (up to 50 files can now be compiled into an EXE).


4.0 b - 12/28/99
----------------
Fixed a bug in the Smacker player for DOS when playing new Smacker 4.0
  files.

Fixed a bug in the Smacker player for DOS when playing an audio track
  compressed with the Bink audio codec.

4.0 a - 12/3/99
---------------
Smacker 4.0 is now fully integrated into the RAD Video Tools (which also
  contains Bink).  There won't be separate Smacker and Bink tools any longer.

New Smacker 4.0 compression - double the quality of your Smacker movies!

Smacker 4.0 now includes optional Bink audio compression.  You can now use
  Bink's perceptually-lossless 8 to 1 audio compressor.

Smacker 4.0 player now shares the CPU much nicer.

Smacker 4.0 player now correctly shows the logo if the movie was paused.

Smacker 4.0 DOS player now uses Miles 6.0 (smaller compiled DOS EXEs).

Smacker 4.0 uses the Bink bandwidth allocation routines to intelligently
  reallocate bandwidth to the frames that need it most.

Added a SmackGetKeyFrame() function to the Smacker 4.0 SDK.

3.2 q - 10/11/99
----------------
Fixed a bug with compiled EXE Smacker files not playing under NT.

3.2 p - 7/8/99
--------------
Added detection for the AMD Athlon processor (which is pretty awesome).
Used EXE compression on the Win32 Smacker player (for smaller video EXEs).
Switched to the Bink Compile to EXE utility.
The player now also adjusts the sound playback rate when playing back at a
  forced frame rate.  This keeps the audio in synch on forced frame rates.

3.2 n - 7/1/99
--------------
Fixed a crash in the player when trying to play a non-Smacker file.

3.2 m - 6/15/99
---------------
Added a new credits window to the Smacker tools.
Fixed the importing of 16-bit BMP files.
Added importing and exporting of PNG files.
Added a new SmackOpen flag (SMACKFROMMEMORY) to open a Smacker file that
  is already in memory.

3.2 k - 4/21/99
---------------
Added a frame rate adjustment feature.  Unlike the existing frame rate
  changer, this feature will add or remove frames to maintain your specified
  frame rate.  So, if you have a 15 fps animation and you adjust it to 30
  fps, then every frame will be copied twice.
Added decompressing of Bink files to the utilities (you can now Smack a
  Bink file).

3.2 j - 3/25/99
---------------
Can detect pretty much any type of CPU now (used the Scitech code).
Fixed some bugs when importing QuickTime files (you can now compress the
  Star Wars trailers).
You can now Smack a Bink file.

3.2 i - 2/10/99
---------------
On the Mac, fixed the mouse cursor always being shown after a
  SmackBufferOpen.
Fixed a few "space-in-the-long-filename" type bugs in the front-end.

3.2 h - 1/29/99
---------------
Added few more debug messages when in debug mode.
Updated the copyright to 1999.

3.2 g - 10/7/98
---------------
Fixed cropping when compressing or converting a QuickTime movie.
Fixed the Sound Processor not using a specified custom output rate.
Added a SmackSetVolume command to the Xtra.
Added stop keys for tab, up, down, left, and right to the Xtra.
Added a "don't skip frames" option to the Xtra.
Fixed DirectSound occasionally failing to load in the Xtra.
Added the new HWND detection code from Miles 5.0.

3.2 f - 5/23/98
---------------
Raised the limit on video complexity (usually gets rid of complexity errors).
Switched to floating point square roots (faster on PIIs and Pentiums).

3.2 e - 5/19/98
---------------
Fixed a bug when compressing using the "every other" flag.

3.2 d - 5/11/98
---------------
Fixed a bug converting AVI files when QuickTime 3 wasn't installed.

3.2 c - 4/19/98
---------------
Fixed importing of QuickTime movies that were sometimes being misidentified
  as TGA files (which would result in an "Out of Memory" error).
Fixed importing of QuickTime movies that had variable internal frame rates.
Fixed importing of 8-bit QuickTime movies.

3.2 b - 4/19/98
---------------
Merged all the make files.
Fixed some debug code in the DOS player that required a key press on palette
  changes.
Fixed an obscure problem with the 16-bit SDK when memory was compacted.

3.2 a - 4/2/98
--------------
QuickTime 3 import support - you can now directly compress and convert
  QuickTime movies.  QuickTime support also gives us access to many other
  video and sound formats as well (like AIFF, AU, DV, Motion JPEG, etc).
New palette rotation option in compressor and graphics processor - allows
  you to set aside a portion of the palette to absorb palette switches
  without flashing.
New palette matching algorithm that matches incoming and outgoing palettes
  to allow limited palette rotation in 8-bit mode.  This can also shrink the
  size of Smacker files with multiple palettes because similiar colors will
  use the similiar palette indexes.
You can now move an image down and to the right during compression or
  conversion by using a negative X and/or Y offset.
Fixed a problem converting or compressing a series of files in the front-end.
Speeded up reporting wave file information.
Made DirectSound volume control linear.
Added command to turn off accelerated blitting in the scriptor.
Added an Xtra command to set the title of the main window in a projector.

3.1 s - 2/17/98
---------------
Front-end now launchs the media viewers through Explorer.
Fixed a bug when Smacking sound files while palette rotation is set.

--------------
Made the sound processor more tolerant of strange wave file headers.
Fixed an offset blitting bug when using start and end multiple blit.

3.1 q - 1/28/98
---------------
Added some new files types to the front-end.
Fixed a bug in the Xtra after a SmackGoto.

3.1 p - 1/21/98 (skipped "o")
-----------------------------
Fixed a bug in the Xtra when playing a range of frames without ever playing 
  the first frame.
Fixed a bug in the Xtra that caused a black flash in interlaced movies that
  contain palette changes.
Fixed a bug in the Xtra that caused the quick play functions to align to the
  lefthand side of the screen.
Added CodeWarrior for the PC support in RAD.h.

3.1 n - 1/15/98
---------------
Switched to a new version of the compiler for the front-end.  Fixed a few
  problems when switching to invalid media.

  unusual palettes (especially Mac palettes on Windows Director).
Fixed a bug in the Smacker Xtra when using SmackGoto.

3.1 L - 12/4/97
---------------
Fixed a bug in SmackFromScreen that also caused transparency problems in
  the Xtra when playing non-divisible by 8 Smacker files.
Made the Xtra copy from the upper-left hand corner of a supplied
  transparent background when the bitmap is larger than the Smacker file.
Fixed SmackSoundOnOff when called on the first frame.

3.1 k - 12/1/97
---------------
No longer attempt to use DirectDraw when running in 4-bit color mode
  (avoids a DirectDraw warning message).
Fixed color matching code in the Mac Xtra.
Fixed transparency offset in the Mac Xtra.

3.1 i - 11/21/97
----------------
Made allowances for Smacker's MSS code to correctly handle when MSS releases
  its digital drivers (use SmackSoundOnOff before releasing the digital
  handle).
Adjusted the way the that SmackSoundOnOff restarts the playback buffers -
  this allows sound sample accurate pausing and resuming.
The Smacker player now releases the sound handle when it loses the focus or
  you pause the video.
Fixed a bug in the Mac SDK when playing a video offset in a window.
Added the new commands in the 3.1 PC Xtra to the Mac Xtra (zoomed by 2 modes, 
  alignment, and video hiding).
The Mac Xtra handles software cursors correctly in direct to screen 
  decompression mode.
The Mac Xtra handles multiple monitors correctly now.
Both the Mac and PC Xtras were changed to return to Lingo faster when not in 
  looping mode.

3.1 h - 11/15/97
----------------
First 3.1 version for the Mac.
Full implementation of the SmackBlit API for both PPC and 68K.
Accelerated blitters in the SmackBuffer API now support 16-bit mode on the
  Mac (up to 12 times faster when playing 2x into 16-bit mode).
Added the software cursor detection API for the Mac SDK.
Removed the SmackBufferUseGDevice function - Smacker now uses the
  window position to determine the destination device.
When using CopyBits, SmackBufferBlit sets the background color to insure 
  correct blitter behavior.
Added all of the new transparent blitting options to the Mac SDK.
Added the SmackBufferStartMultipleBlits and SmackBufferEndMultipleBlits 
  functions to the Mac SDK.
Do blitting with the Move16 instruction on 68040 Macs (up to 25% faster
  blitting).
Fixed a bug where the front-end wasn't remembering the frame rate in the
  Graphics Processor tab.
Made the front-end switch to the drive and directory when compressing files
  in one by one mode.
Fixed blitting bug in transparent modes and 2x 16-bit mode when using odd
  or very small rectangles.

3.1 g - 11/5/97
---------------
Fixed a bug when playing Smackers offset into a buffer.
Fixed a bug where full-screen 320x240 or 320x200 could be flipped vertically.
Fixed a bug with SmackBlitClear not using the offset position.
Fixed a bug in the front-end where the player wouldn't use your options when
  playing a read-only Smacker file.
Fixed a bug in the mixer and compressor where you weren't able to use a
  custom mixing rate.

MMX optimizations in the Smacker codec itself - up to 20% faster!
Fixed a bug with software cursors and the new MultipleBlit functions.
Added Delphi support for the new APIs.

3.1 e - 10/27/97

  are created as normal inverted DIBs.
Fixed a few thunking bugs in the 16-bit version of the SmackBlit API.

3.1 c - 10/15/97
----------------
Fixed the blit acceleration clipping to taskbar even when full screen.
Added an extra couple lines to the player summary.
Added the 3.1 help file.
Fixed a bug in the PC Xtra in the SmackScreenMethod command.
Removed all dependencies to the MSVC run-time library which shrunk most
  of the utilities by 15K.

  couple KB per utility).
Sped up SmkInfo when displaying information on Smacker files.

3.1 b - 10/13/97
----------------
Fixed a bug under NT 4 with non-DCI addressable DirectDraw cards (usually
  high-end OpenGL cards).
Fixed the utilities starting under NT 4.
Made the accelerated blitters check for window visibility before copying.

3.1 a - 9/29/97
---------------
Added MMX support throughout Smacker - playback can now be up to 200%
  faster on MMX machines!
Added the new SmackBlit API for all Smacker platforms - gives SDK users a
  high-performance, low-level blitting library.  Supports 1x, 2x,
  2x smoothed, 2x interlaced to either 8-bit or 16-bit surfaces! See the
  ExamSmkB.C example program for a nifty demo of this new API.
Added replacement blitters for machines where DirectDraw has been installed
  with using the SmackBuffer API - now, whenever possible, Smacker does its
  own direct to screen blitting rather than using DIBSections.
Added masked and merged blitting to the SmackBuffer, SmackBlit, and DOS
  SVGA blit libraries (for much faster transparencies).
The front-end can now process a group of files one-by-one instead of only
  as a group.
Added a cursor API for detecting software cursors and then easily hiding and
  restoring them (for direct to screen blitting or playback).
Rewrote the DirectSound support code - should now have perfect synch and
  work on most emulated sound drivers.
The Xtra and the scriptor now use the merging blitter for faster playback.
Added BitmapToBitmapMerge and BitmapToScreenMerge command to the scriptor.
Added a "Play Last" button on the player tab that will play the last Smacker
  animation that was compressed, mixed, played, etc.  Great for quickly
  viewing the last animation that you created.
Made the Smacker PC Xtra not use DirectSound unless you call the new
  SmackUseDirectSound global command.
Added a 2x playback mode to the Smacker Xtra (including interlaced and
  smoothed modes).
Added a SmackHideVideo command to the Smacker Xtra which allows you to
  hide the video without closing the Smacker object.
Added a SmackSetAlignment command to the Smacker Xtra to control how the
  playback window is automatically aligned.
Added the SmackScreenMethod call to the PC Xtra.
Switched to MASM 6.11 for most of the assembly files.
Added error return codes to the SmackSetTransBackground in the Xtra.
Fixed a playback bug in the Xtra when using a cast member background.
Added Win95, Win95 OSR2, WinNT, MMX, and Pentium II detection to RADSI.
Merged the 16-bit and 32-bit blitters into one 32-bit module.
On NT and 95, SmackBuffers now always use top-down DIBSections (even when
  standard DIBS are requested).

3.0 t - 10/27/97
---------------
Fixed a bug on the Mac where the stereo channels were reversed.

3.0 s - 8/27/97
---------------
Fixed a bug on the Mac when decompressing 16-bit stereo sound.

3.0 r - 8/6/97
--------------
Fixed a nasty race condition in the DirectSound shutdown code.
Fixed the compressor to honor the height when it was larger than the input
  height (pads with black pixels).

3.0 q - 8/1/97
--------------
Fixed an optimizer crash in the compressor and graphic processor when
  halftoning both 8 and 24 bit files together.
Fixed crash in graphics processor if the input and output filenames matched.
Added some extra debug dumping info in the DirectSound module.

3.0 p - 7/25/97 (skipped "o")
-----------------------------
Fixed the filename quoting in the mixer when you used a wave file with a
  space in it.
Fixed a bug in the Mac decompression code where one of the block types was
  decoded incorrectly.
Fixed a bug in the summary window in the Mac 68K player.
Fixed a Mac Xtra bug where the palette wasn't being copied from the Smacker
  frame.

3.0 n - 7/15/97
---------------
Fixed a bug in the graphics file input routines that could cause a crash
  when compressing or converting under NT 4.
Added a debug dumping facility in the SDK. (Add "debug=1" under [Smacker] 
  in the win.ini file to enable.)

3.0 m - 6/25/97
---------------
Worked around an optimizer bug that caused list files not be saved correctly.
Added AVI files as an output file in the graphics processor.
Added a true color support to the graphics processor (it can now copy
  directly from a true color input file to a true color output file).
Fixed crash in RAD system information utility.
Fixed the close button not working in the player.

3.0 L - 6/20/97
---------------
Converted all the Win32 code to the Microsoft compiler - the tools now run
  about 20% faster!

Put all of the common internal Smacker APIs into a utility DLL - saved about
  400K after installation.
Fixed a crash in SmackOpen when the Smack file could not be found.
Fixed a crash in the 16-bit Smacker Xtra.
Fixed the ScreenWindowHWND command in the scriptor.
Removed the SmkW32MS.LIB file from the SDK - use SmackW32.LIB for both
  Microsoft and Watcom compilers.

--------------
Added new Smacker file compiler - compile one or more Smks into an EXE.
Player tab can now view files other than Smacks (double-click).
Added many speed-ups in the Mac Xtra.
Cleaned-up some palette problems in the Mac Xtra.
Fixed the preload option in the Xtra on both PCs and Macs.
Added new SmackGetSummary command in the Xtra to report runtime performance.
Fixed return codes on the utilities.
Tools check for running out of disk space more frequently.
Fixed bug in 16-bit SDK when playing with a file handle.
Fixed a bug in the DOS player where playback could stick on the final frame.
Added a new example for 16-bit DirectDraw with 8-bit off-screen surface.
Updated to Delphi 3 for the Tools front-end.
Dropped the DOS based Tools (the DOS player, scriptor and SDK remain).

Fixed SmackGoto not setting the 16-bit palette.
Compressed the front-end executable.
Fixed the left offsets when playing into a 16-bit surface.
Finished the Mac Xtra for Director.

3.0 i - 5/4/97
--------------
Smacker can decompress directly into a 16-bit buffer (on- or off-screen).
DirectDraw example programs now all support 16-bit surfaces.
Fixed the Windows and icons moving when changing the video mode in Win 95.
Changed the Mac version to try to allocate the GWorld in temp memory if
  normal memory fails (helps in low mem situations).

--------------
Fixed Xtra to not display a black frame when playback begins.
Switched to new Causeway extender.
Fixed a bug in the VESA linear address code when switching to a new VESA
  mode without switching to text mode first.
Added ability to convert 4-bit (16 color AVIs) - these AVIs are very rare.
Fixed a DirectSound deadlock when you use MSS and Smacker both with
  DirectSound - you should now call SmackSoundUseDirectSound only if
  you are using Smacker without MSS - otherwise, always call
  SmackSoundUseMSS.
Added CFM Smacker library to the Mac SDK.
Added an A4-relative library to the Mac SDK.

3.0 f - 2/16/97
