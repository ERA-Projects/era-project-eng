### Version 2.159

#### ERA:
- ## update of era.dll kernel without changing the version:
	- Implemented saving of additional debug information for crash reports:
		- If crash occurs during game saving, full savegame sections info will be logged and "Debug/Era/Savegame Sections" directory with savegame contents will be created.
		- Memory report is written to "log.txt". "PagefileUsage" is total amount of reserved memory (both in RAM and in pagefile). "WorkingSetSize" is the amount of physical RAM used by process.

#### WoG:
- updated plugin "ERA_MultilingualSupport.era":
	- added the ability to translate text from the following txt files using json keys:
	- artevent.txt
	- artraits.txt
	- crgen1.txt
	- crtrait0.txt
	- crtraits.txt
	- objnames.txt
	- zcrgn1.txt
	- zcrtrait.txt
	- Since these files are read when the game is launched, after changing the language in the game, it will be necessary to restart it so that the new text (if it exists) is written to the game memory over the names from the txt files;
	- Keys for translating strings are:
		- for Artifacts, you can replace the name, description, and text when picked up on the Adventure Map:
		```
		"era.artifacts.[art_id].name": string,
		"era.artifacts.[art_id].description": string,
		"era.artifacts.[art_id].event": string
		```
		- for Creatures, you can replace the singular, plural name, and ability description:
		```
		"era.monsters.[monster_id].name.singular": string,
		"era.monsters.[monster_id].name.plural": string,
		"era.monsters.[monster_id].name.description": string
		```
		- for Adventure Map Objects, you can replace the name of standard objects and Creature Dwellings (type 17):
		```
		"era.objects.[object_type]": string,
		"era.objects.17.[object_subtype]": string
		```

> Critical fix for loading saved games!
- information about the RNG operation in multiplayer games has been added to the ERA changelog. The file is located at "/Help/Era manual/era iii changelog.txt", or simply click on the ERA version in the game's main menu to open it;

#### Game Enhancement Mod:
- GameplayEnhancementsPlugin: fixed showing hints for non-active window;


### Version 2.133

#### ERA:
	- ATTENTION! examples of using all innovations are in the file "/Help/Era manual/era iii changelog.txt" or just click on ERA version in the game main menu;
- ## update era.dll core to version 3.9.17:
	- Added support for IME (Input Method Editor) input, used by Asian (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) languages.
	- Added "Lang/\*" directory support for zip archives in Data
	- Introduced another directory for ERM global library scripts: "Data/s/lib_end". Scripts from this directory will be loaded after all other map/global/library scripts.
    Likewise "lib" directory, these scripts do not depend on UN:P5 WoG option state.
	- Improved CombatManager::CastSpell function (used also in BM:C) by temporarily setting CombatManager->ControlSide to the side, controlling casting stack.
	- Rewritten IF:D, IF:F, IF:E commands (multipurpose dialog implementation). Features:
		- Whenever string is accepted as a parameter, it may be any string or string literal. The value will be copied to global settings, no more dependency on z-variables.
		- Dialog IDs are totally ignored (better use 0 or -1 for them for readability). There is only one copy of dialog settings in memory.
		- Dialog settings are totally cleared before IF:D and after IF:E execution.
		- Fixed bugs with phantom empty strings instead of image paths or hints.
		- IF:F accepts 0..6 parameters. Empty parameter means "remove hint".
		- IF:E accepts the following syntaxes: IF:E(v-var index to store result) or IF:E?(any integer variable to store result).
- Extended VR:R command with optional 4-th parameter: VR:R(dummy)/(min)/(max)/(free_param);
	- In network battles deterministic random value generator is used, which generates values using current action ID, round ID and battle ID. An attempt to generate multiple random values in one action produces the same values like 44 44 44. To overcome this issue pass unique value to 4-th parameter for each iteration. It may be stack ID or loop counter, but better XOR it with pre-generated int32 constant, unique for the effect/spell/function, you implement. For instance, 1833290248 XOR stack ID is a good choice.
- Added support for Phoenix Ressurection and Death Stare in network PvP battles.
- Updated "Era Erm Framework":
	- Added support for area shooting creatures to BattleStack_Shoot function.
	- Synchronized with Launcher "Era Erm Framework" version.
- Added the following export types and functions to era.dll:

    All pointers may be null. All fields must be writable by dialog processing routines and must be considered "dirty" after dialog processing except the field, where result values are written.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, Era always asks permission to load global scripts on map start or scripts reloading if map has internal scripts. The permission text was changed from "skip" to "load" by default. The following language key must be re-translated: 'era.global_scripts_vs_map_scripts_warning'. WoG Option 5 is always set to 3 (ask for loading global scripts if map has internal scripts) before any scripts are loaded, thus there is no more necessity to keep it in WoG Options. UN:P5/# instruction in map internal scripts controls, wether map author forces global scripts loading or not.

	- ATTENTION! examples of using all innovations are in the file /Help/Era manual/era iii changelog.txt;
	
- ## updating the ERA.dll kernel to version 3.9.15:
- Updated erm_hooker.era plugin to version 3.0:
  - Switched to modern patching API from era.dll.
  - Implemented protection from overlapping patches.
  - Implemented protection from patch restoration if patched code was changed by third-party code.
  - Improved patch bridge code.
  - Added version reporting (RMB on Credits in game menu).
  - Patch report file (Debug/Era/erm hooks.txt) uses human readable ERM function names instead of numeric IDs now.
- Added support for ERM script libraries. Scripts, located in "Data/s/lib" directory are considered library scripts. They are loaded before other global scripts and before     all map scripts (both internal and external). Such scripts must be propertly written, use only named variables and functions with prefixes. They must not influence the gameplay, interface or other scripts. They should be treated as a callable collection of functions, together with related constants and data structures.
- Era Erm Framework scripts are moved to "Data/s/lib" and can be used in maps now, even in maps, disabling global ERM scripts.
- Fixed DL:H command. Any string is accepted as hint. The hint is copied to a dialog internal location and automatically freed on dialog closing. No more need to use global z-variables for custom dialog hints. Hints are not interpolated at show time anymore.
- Modified "IF:L" command to allow any string as argument and automatically escape '%' character. Previously strings with '%' led to garbage results or even crashes.
- Modified "HE:B0", "HE:B1", "HE:B3" commands to allow any string as argument.
- Rewritten WoG "ApplyString" and "NewMesMan" functions, allowing any string in multiple ERM commands (CA, LE, GE, etc):
	- Disabled syntax of setting event message to the one from event with given ID (ex, "GE:M30" for event with ID 30).
	- Deprecated syntax of using -1 instead of empty string.
- Extended SN:K(str)/(ind)/[?](strchar or char code) syntax. If result is integer variable, char code is returned instead.
- Extended 'VR:F' command with the 4-th parameter:
    - If (defaultValue) is specified and variable does not fit (minValue)..(maxValue) range, it will be set to (defaultValue):
    ```
    !!VR(intVar):F(minValue)/(maxValue)/(showErrors)/(defaultValue);
    ```
- Improved stability of dynamic ERM commands execution using 'ExecErmCmd' API. Added support for all ERM 2 variables in command parameters.
- Extended ERM fast memory buffer for string literals and string arguments in ERM commands and triggers from 1 MB to 3 MB.
- Added possibility to increase buffer size for compiled erm scripts using heroes3.ini setting. The default value is 128 MB. Single ERM command need ~0.5 KB:
	- CompiledErmBufSize = 134217728; maximum size of a buffer for compiled erm scripts (does not influence dynamic compilation on the fly using PersistErmCmd or ExecErmCmd)
- Disabled ERM tracking for Era Erm Framework mouse and keyboard handling code.
- Improved ERM tracking report formatting.
- Added new event "OnBeforeLoadGame" for plugins. It occurs right after old game leaving and before new game loading.
- Added new option "Debug.CopySavegameOnCrash" to heroes3.ini. The option is on by default and enabled copying of last used savegame to debug directory on crash, which may be useful for crash investigation.
- Moved a few messages from code into era.json for further localization:
  - era.no_memory_for_erm_optimization;
  - era.game_crash_message;
- Refactored and updated Era SDK files in "Tools/Era/SDK". For C++ use "era.h" and "era.cpp". For Delphi use "era.pas".

- Added the following functions to Era Erm Framework:
    - ```
        !?FU(Interpolate);
        ; Interpolates ERM variables inside given string (%v1, etc). Can be used for nested translation strings like %T(...) is json.
        !#VA(strPtr:x);    Source string.
        !#VA(resultPtr:x); OUT. Result string.
    
        Example:
    
        !!VRi^edu_age^:S33;
        !!VRs^edu_name^:S^Xeon^;
        !!VR(templateStr:z):S^%%s(edu_name) is %%i(edu_age) years old^;
        !!IF:M(templateStr); displays "%s(edu_name) is %i(edu_age) years old"
        !!FU(Interpolate):P(templateStr)/?(interpolatedStr:z);
        !!IF:M(interpolatedStr); displays "Xeon is 33 years old"
        ```
    - ```
        !?FU(Trim);
        ; Trims #0..#32 characters (space and control characters) from both sides of the string.
        !#VA(strPtr:x);    Source string.
        !#VA(resultPtr:x); OUT. Result string.

        Example:

        !!VR(text:z):S^    Hello World    ^;
        !!FU(Trim):P(text)/?(text);
        !!IF:M^%(text)^; displays "Hello World" without leading and trailing spaces
        ```
    - ```
        !?FU(StrPos);
        ; Finds the first occurance of needle string in the haystack string. Returns offset from string start or -1 for faulure
        !#VA(haystackPtr:x); String to search in
        !#VA(needlePtr:x);   String to seacrh for
        !#VA(result:x);      Result offset in the haystack string or -1.
        !#VA(offset:x);      Zero-based offset in haystack string to start search from. Default: 0.

        Example:

        !!VR(text:z):S^Hello World^;
        !!FU(StrPos):P(text)/^World^/?(substrPos:y);
        !!IF:M^%(substrPos)^; displays "6"
        ```
    - ```
        !?FU(StrReplace);
        ; Replaces all occurencies of Pattern string in the Source string with Replacement string. Returns final string.
        ; Can be used inside triggers only.
        !#VA(sourcePtr:x);      Original string to perform replacements in
        !#VA(patternPtr:x);     What string to replace
        !#VA(replacementPtr:x); Replacement string
        !#VA(result:x);         Result string index

        Example:
    
        !!VR(text:z):S^You should cast the spell. Spell casting increases your intelligence^;
        !!FU(StrReplace):P(text)/^cast^/^learn^/?(text);
        !!IF:M^%(text)^; You should learn the spell. Spell learning increases your intelligence
        ```
- Added the following constans to Era Erm Framework:
    - CHAT_EVENT_TYPE_XXX   for 'OnChat' event subtype
    - CHAT_EVENT_RESULT_XXX for 'OnChat' event result
- Added the following exported functions to era.dll:

  (* Compiles single ERM command without !! prefix and conditions and saves its compiled code in persisted memory storage.
     Returns non-nil opaque pointer on success and nil on failure. Trailing semicolon is optional *)
  function PersistErmCmd (CmdStr: pchar): {n} pointer; stdcall;

  (* Executes previously compiled and persisted ERM command. Use PersistErmCmd API for compilation *)
  procedure ExecPersistedErmCmd (PersistedCmd: pointer); stdcall;

  (* Translates given string. Returns static translated string address, which will never be deallocated *)
  function trStatic (const Key: pchar): pchar; stdcall;

  (* Translates given string. Pass parameters as pairs of (key, value). Returns temporary string address, which must be immediately copied to a safe location *)
  function trTemp (const Key: pchar; Params: pointer to array of pchar; LastParamIndex: integer): pchar; stdcall;

  (* Returns human readable string for ERM event ID. Usually it's ERM trigger human readable name or ERM function name.
     The caller MUST free returned memory block using MemFree from era.dll *)
  function GetTriggerReadableName (EventId: integer): {O} pchar; stdcall;

  (* Installs new hook at specified address. Returns pointer to bridge with original code. Optionally specify address of a pointer to write applied patch structure pointer to.
     It will allow to rollback the patch later.
     Handler function must use stdcall convention. It receives hook context pointer and must return non-zero value in order to execute overwritten code.  *)
  function HookCode (Addr: pointer; HandlerFunc: THookHandler; {n} AppliedPatch: ppointer): pointer; stdcall;

  type
    PHookContext = ^THookContext;
    THookContext = packed record
      EDI, ESI, EBP, ESP, EBX, EDX, ECX, EAX: integer;
      RetAddr:                                pointer;
    end;

    THookHandler = function (Context: PHookContext): LONGBOOL; stdcall;

  (* Calculates number of bytes to be overwritten during hook placement *)
  function CalcHookPatchSize (Addr: pointer): integer; stdcall;

  (* The patch will be rollback and internal memory and freed. Do not use it anymore *)
  procedure RollbackAppliedPatch ({O} AppliedPatch: pointer); stdcall;

  (* Frees applied patch structure. Use it if you don't plan to rollback it anymore *)
  procedure FreeAppliedPatch ({O} AppliedPatch: pointer); stdcall;

-  Modified some exported function signatures. Many of them now use TInt32Bool type (32 bit 0 or 1) instead of boolean for better compatiblity with ERM:

      type
        TIsCommanderIdFunc       = function (MonId: integer): TInt32Bool stdcall;
        TIsElixirOfLifeStackFunc = function (Stack: Heroes.PBattleStack): TInt32Bool stdcall;
    
      function IsCommanderId (MonId: integer): TInt32Bool; stdcall;
      function SetIsCommanderIdFunc (NewImpl: TIsCommanderIdFunc): {n} TIsCommanderIdFunc; stdcall;
      function IsElixirOfLifeStack (Stack: Heroes.PBattleStack): TInt32Bool; stdcall;
      function SetIsElixirOfLifeStackFunc (NewImpl: TIsElixirOfLifeStackFunc): {n} TIsElixirOfLifeStackFunc; stdcall;
    
      (* Returns 32-character unique key for current game process. The ID will be unique between multiple game runs. *)
      procedure GetProcessGuid: static_pchar; stdcall;


- Increased performance of "Substr" function from Era Erm Framework.
- Changed unsafe Era hooks with manually specified hook sizes to fully automatical hooks with hook length calculation using integrated disassembler engine.
- Fixed bug: "OnWinGame" and "OnLoseGame" events were not executed after "OnGameLeave", because ERM engine was disabled by that time. Now "OnWinGame" and "OnLoseGame" occur right before "OnGameLeave".
- Fixed ERM bug. Local array item access by variable index lacked lazy evaluation support. Constructions like "!!if&v1<>v1/(array[hugeValueVar])" used to produce runtime warnings. For now invalid item index is changed into 0, producing runtime error only in case of real item access.
- Fixed IsCommanderId function crashing.
- Fixed game bug: typing in chat bar produced phantom chat mouse button click events.
- Fixed crash, occuring when "Debug.TrackErm" option is disabled. The bug was introduced in version 3.9.14.
- Fixed bug: ERM memory context was lost in exceptions because of new fast exit to main menu implementation.
- Fixed WoG complete AI battle detection. Autoclosing dialog timer is not compared to 0 anymore. The "gosolo" cheat works in battles again without ERM errors.
- Deprecated exported 'ApiHook' and 'Hook' functions. 'Hook' will show error message, while ApiHook is preserved for legacy only. Use 'HookCode' instead or patcher_x86 API directly.
- Fixed old event handling bug. Triggering ERM event with disabled ERM resulted in global event not being generated either. For example, Era and plugins could not handle 'OnSavegameRead' event if ERM was disabled at the moment of savegame loading.

#### Advanced Classes Mod:
- Now piecing spell immunity no longer works on own troops
- fixed self heal on First Aid Tent when right-clicking it in combat

- TrainerX requires ERA 3.9.15 to work.
- Now TrainerX can be used in any map including Valery's maps that prevents WoGifications.
- Added Ctrl-click on hero portrait in Trainer main interface to centre the camera at the hero's location

#### WoG Scripts:
- Fixed an error when clicking on the morale amount with the 10SSkills mod active;
- Neutral stack exp: Fixed the interaction with stack exp option. It is possible to enable neutral stack exp without enabling the other stack exp.

  - Magic of Decateron;
  - Pentagram;
  - Penteract;
  - Tesseract;


### Version 2.101

#### ERA:
- Fixed old event handling bug. Triggering ERM event with disabled ERM resulted in global event not being generated either. For example, Era and plugins could not handle 'OnSavegameRead' event if ERM was disabled at the moment of savegame loading.

- Fix cheats not working

#### Random Wallpaper Mod:
- unnecessary files were removed;

#### WoG Graphics Fix Lite:

### Version 2.100

#### ERA:
	- ATTENTION! examples of using all innovations are in the file /Help/Era manual/era iii changelog.txt;
	
- updating the ERA.dll kernel to version 3.9.14:
	- added screenshot capturing support:
		Added support for capturing game screenshots in png/jpg formats. The following function was exported in era.dll:

  			(*
    		Captures screenshot and saves it as a file. The format is detected automatically by extension. The following extensions
    		are supported: 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'png'. By default in-game cursor is also captured. Returns success flag.

    		'Quality' is used to specify jpeg saving quality (0..100).
    		'Flags'   is a bit mask of function flags.

    		TS_FLAG_HIDE_CURSOR = 1; // Hide cursor
  			*)
  		- function TakeScreenshot (FilePath: pchar; Quality: integer; Flags: integer): TDwordBool; stdcall;
		- Added new option "Debug.CaptureScreenshotOnCrash" to heroes3.ini. The option allows to capture screenshot on crash and save it in "Debug/Era/screenshot.jpg".
	- improved ERM execution stability:
		- Added automatical ERM tracking reset and settings restoration on game start or load.
		- Implemented automatical "Debug/Era" directory cleanup before generating debug files on crash.
	- improved debugging facilities:
		- Added runtime API for controlling ERM tracking. It can be used to omit well tested library from final ERM tracking log or for tracking particular code units only:
			- Added new option "Debug.AllowRuntimeErmTrackingControl" to heroes3.ini. The option enables or disables runtime control on ERM tracking. It's enabled by default and should be disabled in case of complex bug tracking, where no code can be trusted.
			-  The following functions were exported in era.dll:
				- procedure DisableErmTracking; stdcall; // Pauses ERM tracking. All previously tracked info is preserved.
				- procedure EnableErmTracking; stdcall; // Resumes ERM tracking.
				- procedure RestoreErmTracking; stdcall; // Sets ERM tracking to value, specified in heroes3.ini (the one used before runtime manipulations)
				- procedure ResetErmTracking; stdcall; // Clears all previously recorded tracks.
	- improved network gaming stability:
		- ### Warning. Using "OnGameEnter" for ERM hooks in network games does not work in Era < 3.9.14.
		
		Added support for "OnGameEnter" and "OnGameLeave" events in network games. Previously savegame transfer and loading on remote side used to trigger "OnAfterSavegameLoad", but not "OnGameLeave" + "OnGameEnter". That's why using erm_hooker plugin with "OnGameEnter" event resulted in unset hooks after the first end of turn.
		  In network games the sequence of events after remote side end of turn is the following:
		  
		    "OnGameLeave"     - here were restore UN:C patches and erm_hooker unset hooks
		    "OnSavegameRead"  - reading transferred savegame
		    "OnAfterLoadGame" - fully loaded trasferred savegame
		    "OnGameEnter"     - install UN:C patches and ERM hooks once again

	- other:
		- ERM execution is disabled after "OnGameLeave" event. MP3 and real time triggers are not executed outside of game main loop anymore. Previously triggers were executed in the context of game main menu.
		- Updated erm_hooker.era plugin and debug map.
		- "OnAdvMapTileHint" was renamed to "OnAdventureMapTileHint". The previous name is deprecated, but is kept for compatibility reasons.
		- Deprecated 'OnAbnormalGameLeave' event. HD mod way to return from combat screen to main game menu is not supported anymore.
		- Internal settings module refactoring.
		- IP selection dialog will no be shown in multiplayer setup screen if PC has only one IP address available.
		- Fixed ERM commands tracking with ';' inside string literals (ex. \^...;...^).
		- Fixed inaccurate routine and line detection by address in DebugMaps module.
		- Fixed buttons.dll plugin debug map.

### Version 2.97

#### ERA:
	- ATTENTION! examples of using all innovations are in the file /Help/Era manual/era iii changelog.txt;

- updating the ERA.dll kernel to version 3.9.13:
	- Improved exceptions tolerance for ERM engine (triggers and commands). ERM memory clean up is performed in case of exception, allowing to reuse ERM engine later after recovery. Exceptions may be used, for instance, to trigger fast quit from deeply nested dialogs.
	- Improved crash/exception handling. HD and WoG handlers are not called at all. Era's handler is called only once. Crash reports become more stable and accurate. Previosly multiple exception could take place and override the same logs.
	- Added experimental (may be subject of removal) exported function to quit from any dialog in main game menu.
	- Commanders without UNDEAD flag are also handled by Elixir of Life now. Plugins may override IsElixirOfLifeStack exported function to implement other behavior.
	- Added exported functions to era.dll, more steps on moving WoG hard-coded mechanics into replaceable API format. API setters return previously set implementation functions or null.
- The button to launch the language selection dialog now works in the campaign menu window;

#### Advanced Classes Mod:
- in multiplayer games text from Estate/Natural Healer/Secret Sets ability wont show up for remote player

### Version 2.968

#### ERA:
	- ATTENTION! examples of using all innovations are in the file /Help/Era manual/era iii changelog.txt;

- updating the ERA.dll kernel to version 3.9.12:
	- Implemented advanced ERM memory synchronization means in network games.
	-  Added !!IP:M command to mark associative variables (SN:W, i^^, s^^) for further synchronization.
  Syntax:
    !!IP:M^var_name_1^/^var_name_2^/...;
    !!IP:M0/^array_var_name_1^/^array_var_name_2^/...;
	-  Added !!IP:S command to perform synchronization of all marked variables and arrays. Use !!IP:D to specify targets for synchronization.
	After calling it marked variables cache is cleared.
	!!IP:S is automatically called right before sending 'start battle' network event with !!IP:D-1.
	- Added GAME_TYPE_XXX constants to Era Erm Framework (see UN:V 5-th parameter).
	- Added the following global variables to Era Erm Framework:
	i^battle_isActingSideUiUser^: bool. Is TRUE if acting side player is local human and thus can use all UI actions.
	Use it to prevent non-active network player from performing state changing UI actions.
	- Added the following functions to Era Erm Framework:
		- !?FU(Array_Move);
		Copies part of the array into another part of the array, overwriting existing values in a smart way.
		- !?FU(Array_Splice);
		  Deletes specified number of items from start index and inserts new items in the same position afterwards.
		- !?FU(ActivateNextStack);
		  Finds and activates next stack. Returns TRUE on success and FALSE if nobody can move in this phase.
	- Implemented possibility to select desired IP for multiplayer gaming.
	Vanilla game uses the first found IP address for PC, while PC may belong to multiple networks: LAN, WLAN, Virtual LAN, Internet (white IP address).
	- Added the following exported functions to era.dll:
		- Allocates new function ID and binds it to specified name if name is free, otherwise returns already binded ID.
		This function can be used to implement custom ERM events in plugins.
		The result is 1 if new ID was allocated, 0 otherwise.
		function AllocErmFunc (FuncName: pchar; {i} out FuncId: integer): TDwordBool; stdcall;
		typedef bool (__stdcall* TAllocErmFunc) (const char* EventName, int32_t &EventId);
	- Added new event for plugins/Lua: 'OnAfterReloadLanguageData'. It occurs whenever Era reloads all language json data from disk.

#### Advanced Classes Mod:
- prevents message display after combats for non active player

- Fixed the immunity behaviour of Fire Mage if they happen to be Hypnotized
- Reworked Fire Shield rework. Now instead of checking Creature Id to know whether they should be immune to Fire Shield, we use hook to check if they should. This also prevent Fire Shield to visually show if the target is immune.

- Partially fixed MP support - now in PVP battle, the change of commander spell type would be reflected to another side.

- Paladin Exp and Brute Gold: Fixed multiple logic glitches.
- Paladin Exp: Now bonus exp from damage is maxed at 10 million
(with all the bonuses. The value can be greater without overflow, only it's for balance concern)
- Added commander class constants (it's strongly recommended to add a new .erm with all the ACM constants for convenience)
- Reset bought spells when a commander is bought from a town
- Fixed AI not using summon elemental spells
- Fixed localization of "None" English word in erm
- Added new class names for adventurers of each faction

- Fixed GM Quicksand messing up highlight
- Commander class is now replay proof
- Kill count is now adding only after kill (instead of before kill). This also fixes in some situation that the kill isn't really there but is still considered valid, for example, some block/reflect abilities of the attacking unit, that prevents a kill, or the attacking unit is killed in the process (like burned by Fire Shield).
- Fixed STOIC_WATCHMAN not giving 10% resistance as the description says

	- If not enough stats to be stolen, battle log shows the exact value stolen;
- small correction for Spell Point regeneration display
- secret class improvements;
- Fixed duplicate option in "Choose Class" option (at the start of the game). There are two "Ask after 5 levels". Now one of them is now Ask after 2.
- Fixed artifact set detection. Equipping two artifacts with the same name no longer reduces 1 from your set pieces count..
- The max kill count for commander is now at 9999 (visual change)
- AI now can also advance their class set stats with each victory (if they mange to loot one from human. They do not drop class sets due to &1000 condition);

- Buff the Landmine spell by doing these changes:
	- Now the spell can be cast if there are native terrain creatures on enemy stack

	- Improved Arcane Prophet ability (now damage increase i shown when starting the combat and not randomly selected before every cast. Damage increase directly visible in the spell book). Updated artifact description of SP Reg artifacts.
	- Druid Concentration Perk now works with battle replay.
	- Lord ability or Town plunder now has a 2 week cool-down for each town

- Spells learned with Eagle Eye will be reset in case of Battle Replay

- Fix compatibility with spell description mod. Now the incorrect text from spell book is disabled.

- Added a failed safe condition for Commander's Strike All Around script for secondary targets. This sciprt won't work if the attacker, the defender and the secondary targets are all in the same side (possible with Berserk); To solve this, we need to introduce a new hook to get the actual attacking stack. But this is a rare situation so we are not doing it for now"
