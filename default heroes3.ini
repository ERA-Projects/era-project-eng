CpuTargetLevel     = 50;        reduces CPU load to 0..100%. Real effect will be even greater than specified value
UseOnlyOneCpuCore  = 0;         if 1, only one CPU core will be used, decreasing probability of crashes
AutoSelectPcIpMask =;           which IP to use for multiplayer gaming. empty string to display in-game dialog with IP selection, IP mask otherwise like 192.168.* or 192.168.5.*
LoadCD             = 0;         if 1, an attempt to load resources from CD disk will be made, increasing game initialization by about 3-5 seconds
ErmLegacySupport   = 1;         if 1, reduces problems with old ERM scripts at the cost of slower ERM execution speed (~-15% speed on modern CPU)
ResourceCacheSize  = 200000000; maximum cache for Era extra resources (at least png files). Set to 0 to disable caching at all.
CompiledErmBufSize = 134217728; maximum size of a buffer for compiled erm scripts (does not influence dynamic compilation on the fly using PersistErmCmd or ExecErmCmd)
Language           = en;        language code (only a..z, a..Z and _ characters allowed, prefer 2 character lower case locales)

Debug                                = 1;     allow debugging at all or not, see Debug\Era directory
Debug.Everything                     = 0;     if true, enable all boolean debugging options at once
Debug.AbortOnError                   = 0;     abort on serious, but not critical errors or not
Debug.LogDestination                 = File;  logging driver: File or Console
Debug.LogVirtualFileSystem           = 0;     if true, Virtual File System work will be logged
Debug.LogWindowMessagesOpt           = 0;     if true, main window messages will be logged
Debug.DumpVirtualFileSystem          = 0;     if true, all Virtual File System mappings (per file) will be written to log during initialization
Debug.DumpSavegameSections           = 0;     if true, each game saving will create dump of each Era section in a separate file
Debug.TrackErm                       = 1;     if true, ERM commands and triggers will be tracked for report/debugging purposes
Debug.TrackErm.MaxRecords            = 10000; maximal number of commands and events to track (1 record ~= 100 bytes RAM)
Debug.TrackErm.DumpCommands          = 1;     if true, all commands texts will be saved during execution, allowing to track ERM commands, executed by plugins
Debug.TrackErm.IgnoreEmptyTriggers   = 1;     if true, trigger start - trigger end pairs without executed commands will be ignored
Debug.Rng                            = 0;     if > 0, random number generator usage will produce debug messages (use 1..3 values for details level)
Debug.CaptureScreenshotOnCrash       = 1;     if true, screenshot is captured on crash and saved in Debug\Era\screenshot.jpg.
Debug.CopySavegameOnCrash            = 1;     if true, the last used savegame is copied to Debug\Era\savegame.gm1 on crash.
Debug.AllowRuntimeErmTrackingControl = 1;     if true, enables usage of exported ERM tracking control API. Disable for total debugging.
