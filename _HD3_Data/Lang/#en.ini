2. Posting messages that do not carry any meaning or align with the lobby's theme. Excessive messaging and excessive use of text formatting.
3. Using the language foreign to the selected chat (the use of English is allowed in all chats in case of necessity).

5. Posting hazardous links and links to offensive, provocative or obscene content (pornography, traumatic images etc.).
6. Publicly judging and/or hindering the actions of the administration.

In case of violation of these principles, the administration may take the following measures:
- Censoring of user’s existing chat messages or game descriptions
- Read-only status: the user can no longer send new messages or change game descriptions
- Blocking a particular user's account
- Full ban from entering the lobby
